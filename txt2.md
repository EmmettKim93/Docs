A decentralized application, commonly referred to as a dApp, is a software application that operates on a decentralized network. This means that instead of relying on a central server or authority to store and manage data and facilitate transactions, a dApp uses a decentralized, distributed network of computers, based on blockchain technology, to maintain its operations.

Unlike traditional applications, where a single entity has control over the data and infrastructure, dApps are designed to be trustless, meaning that the participants in the network can interact with each other and conduct transactions without the need for intermediaries.

globaldce browser project goal it to deliver a browser with globaldce integration allowing users to access and interact with globaldce dapps directly within the browser without relying on a gateway. Globaldce browser users can browse traditional websites as well as globaldce dapps and interact with globaldce resources seamlessly.
