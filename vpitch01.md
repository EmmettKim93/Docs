Why although the internet was initially envisioned as a peer-to-peer network with built-in privacy and security, the people working on it later on started to depend on centralized third-party services and a client server model? The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with countries around the world, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice...intolerance and oppression. And where once you had thanks to the internet the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told...if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War. Terror. Disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic, you turned to the now politicians in power. They promised you order. They promised you peace. And all they demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
At globaldce we sought to end that silence. 

We created globaldce to remind people around the world of what they have forgotten. Our hope is to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom are more than words - they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this politicians remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow this invitation to pass. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek...then I ask you to join us. And together, we shall give them a globaldce that shall never, ever, be forgot!
