globaldce is a better nakomoto consensus
gloabldce can be used to build new blockchain applications with new consensus models
globaldce based blockchain applications can interoperate to coherent ecosystem

Blockchain at its hart is a trust minimisation mechanism. It allows a consortium of actors, individuals and/or organizations, that have to work together but do not necessarly trust each other but need to work together inoder for the market to form. It can be a voting system whw cast the votes. it can be a supply chain system how audits that. it can be a medical record system who can acess your mecal record.  

The highest-level description is that GlobalDCE serves as a software designed for exploring blockchain apps. 

GlobalDCE goes beyond traditional boundaries supporting both existing torrents as well as its native decentralized data sharing protocol. In practice, this means users have the convenience of downloading torrent files through the integrated torrent client within GlobalDCE in addition to addition to accessing blockchain webapps.

Furthermore, GlobalDCE's peer-to-peer protocol empowers users to self-publish blockchain apps directly from their browsers, eliminating the need for the cumbersome setup and management of separate web servers or relying on third-party hosting. The magic happens through the globaldce facilitating the sharing and hosting of files, and blockchain apps among multiple users. In addition to this, GlobalDCE seamlessly integrates with the HTTP protocol for connection to traditional servers, and it's also adept at facilitating peer-to-peer data sharing through torrents. 


Globaldce enables developers to build and deploy smart contract and decentralized applications with no upfront cost. A developer can write the gvm code, initialize it on his computer and deploy it offchain with no globaldce native coin while still be able to intract with other globaldce node.

Developers should be payed to develop and not pay to develop! 


globaldce is built on top of reimplementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which means that it benefits from the same security and reliability that has made Bitcoin so successful. But globaldce takes things to the next level by adding a content delivery network that enables consorship resistant content. This means that you can stream videos, download files, and access decentralized application, no matter where you are in the world.

In addition to its content delivery network, globaldce also offers peer to peer transactions and because globaldce is built of the same Nakamoto consensus that Bitcoin protocol uses, you can trust that your transactions will be secure and reliable.

But perhaps the most exciting thing about globaldce is its potential for growth and innovation. With its powerful combination of Bitcoin like cryptocurrency and a censorship resistant content delivery network, globaldce has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about the flow of money and information. And because it's still in its early stages, there's plenty of room for developers and entrepreneurs to build new applications and services on top of the platform.

So if you're looking for a cryptocurrency that combines security, speed, and innovation, look no further than globaldce. Whether you're a content creator or a business owner, globaldce has everything you need.




Hi

I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you within the GlobalDCE community. If you have any questions or would like further information about the project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Wishing you continued success in your endeavors.

Warm regards,



Globaldce can be used in a variety of scenarios, particularly in situations involving collaborative efforts among multiple entities that do not necessarily trust each other. It can serve as:

1. A secure voting system, ensuring the integrity of the vote count.
2. An effective tool in supply chain management and auditing processes to guarantee compliance.
3. A robust platform for managing medical records securely.

These applications become essential when dealing with global challenges and trust issues that cannot be easily resolved through centralized institutions, much like the challenges we've seen in social media's control over free speech.

Globaldce's innovative approach eliminates the necessity for centralized control, fostering a shared logic. Initially employed in the financial sector, we are now exploring its potential across diverse sectors including healthcare, communication, telecommunications, and various marketplaces.

In any scenario involving a consortium of entities that needs to collaborate inorder to form a market. Trust issues must be resolved, necessitating collective effort. It can be used as :
a voting system, well you know how counts the vote. 
A supply chain or an audit process to ensure compliance. 
A medical record system. 

The challenges arise due to globalization and a lack of trust. These issues are complex and can not be addressed by establishing a central institution or authority, much like we've seen in social media's  control over free speech. 

Globaldce eliminates the need for such central control and promotes a shared logic. We initially applied this concept in finance and are now exploring its potential in healthcare, communication, telecommunication, and various marketplaces.
