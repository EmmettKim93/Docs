In a world where "crypto" is echoing louder each day, we're witnessing the emergence of something truly groundbreaking in finance. Cryptocurrency, often considered a new frontier, brings with it a revolutionary concept - a decentralized record-keeping system- also called blockchain. It's a network where peers are rewarded in crypto for validating records, creating a constantly evolving ledger that's self-enforcing and resistant to external control.

This radical innovation introduces the possibility of a new form of currency, a new form of investment asset, and even a new kind of computing. Those deeply immersed in the world of crypto harbor ambitious plans and visions, yet the full extent of its utility remains uncertain. Conversely, there are skeptics who view crypto as a scam or a bubble, primarily because many of the promised benefits have yet to materialize.

But consider this: 
Imagine that the internet becomes more and more its own digital economy with its own series of rules, and that digital economy is a global one.

It will need its own systems of recordkeeping, its own systems of property rights, its own way of conducting transactions.

This digital economy demands a fresh approach to record-keeping and trust, and that's where crypto steps in.

At globaldce, we believe in revisiting the fundamentals of crypto and starting from scratch. Our mission is to maintain the decentralized and permissionless nature of the Nakamoto consensus that made bitcoin successful while providing developers with tools to create blockchain applications that can be very flexible, that can even have their own consensus model.

GlobalDCE, short for Global Decentralized Collaboration Environment, is the embodiment of this vision. It's a protocol designed to simplify the development, deployment, and usage of blockchain applications. While blockchain applications have gained traction in fintech, their applicability in other domains remains limited due to the high costs and reliance on consensus models unsuitable for new businesses.

GlobalDCE serves as a toolbox for blockchain developers, allowing them to experiment with new blockchain architectures while ensuring interoperability between different projects. In this way, we're shaping the future of blockchain applications, extending their potential beyond the realm of finance and into a new uncharted territory.
